# SenBa Problem Statement
Existing alert systems on mobile devices fail to inform users of a text message’s content
through audio notifications. When a phone receives a text message, the device usually
either vibrates if on silent mode or plays one user-selected notification sound. However,
this results in homogeneous notifications where the user is required to pick up their
device and check the notification screen to see a brief summary of the first words in a
text.
Whilst this problem may not be significant, a potential solution to this problem could be
instrumental. Today, where notification sounds have become prevalent in one’s day to
day, a more informative sound can benefit the productivity of a user who is working
remotely or behind the steering wheel. Another potential use-case of the content-aware
alert sound is if a user has their phone on the “Do Not Disturb” setting, then they can
only be alerted to a text if it has an emergency sentiment. Furthermore, this may also be
a helpful feature for people with developmental disabilities by providing them with audial
cues that can help them understand the sender’s tone conveyed in a text message.

# SenBa Solution
With Machine Learning (ML) becoming more common in our everyday lives, we aim to
take advantage of online resources to build an app that aims to solve this problem. In
particular, we have chosen to focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP). Current
applications of NLP include use cases such as Google Search for better search results,
predictive text when writing emails, and Google Translate for language translation. Our
focus within the field of NLP will be on sentiment analysis.
We propose an alternative solution in the form of Sentiment-Based Alerts–SenBA. This
will provide smart customization based on the text message’s sentiment, purpose, or
importance through a model-selected sound that better conveys its content. We aim to
improve a user's experience with intelligent alert systems by delivering a text message’s
overall sentiment or importance through seamless audial cues, helping them be more
productive when working on other tasks.
